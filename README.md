# Implicit Closure in Swift's reduce Function

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with using the '+' operator implicitly within Swift's `reduce` function.  While it might seem concise, it lacks clarity and could lead to problems in more complex situations where the intended operation isn't immediately obvious.

The `bug.swift` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.swift` file provides a more explicit and safer solution.

Using explicit closures improves code readability and maintainability, preventing unexpected behavior and making the code easier to understand and debug.
